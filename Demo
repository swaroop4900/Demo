**Subject:** Leave Request for Tomorrow

Dear [Managers' Names],

I hope you're doing well. Apologies for the late notice, but I wanted to inform you that we are planning a baby cradle ceremony for our little one tomorrow. Due to this, I will need to take the day off.

Please let me know if there's anything urgent that requires my attention beforehand, and I'll do my best to address it.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,  
Swaroop
