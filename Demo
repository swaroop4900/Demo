Description:

Merge all the development code from the feature branch into the master branch in the Git repository.
Ensure the merge is successful without conflicts.
Conduct post-verification checks to confirm that the code works as expected in the master branch.
Ensure that all tests pass and that the integration with other systems or branches is smooth.
