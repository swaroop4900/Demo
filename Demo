**Jira Ticket: Automation for Container Image Updates and Cleanup Policy in Artifact Registry**

**Summary:**
Create automation to update container images in Google Cloud Artifact Registry every 30 days and implement a cleanup policy to delete images older than 120 days. Ensure that all CloudBees CDRO container images are backed up and available in Nexus to avoid unintentional deletion.

**Details:**
1. **Automation**:  
   - Schedule a task (using a cron job, Cloud Scheduler, or Jenkins pipeline) to automatically update the required container images in the Google Cloud Artifact Registry every 30 days.
   
2. **Cleanup Policy**:  
   - Implement a cleanup policy in the Artifact Registry that removes container images older than 120 days to optimize storage usage.

3. **Nexus Backup**:  
   - Ensure that all CloudBees CDRO-related container images are uploaded and stored in Nexus. Verify that no images related to CDRO are accidentally deleted during the cleanup process.

4. **Verification**:  
   - Post-implementation verification to ensure:
     - Automation runs successfully every 30 days.
     - The cleanup policy correctly retains images for 120 days.
     - All CDRO-related images are available in Nexus.

5. **Backout Plan**:  
   - In case of issues with the automation or cleanup policy, revert to a manual process and restore any deleted images from backups.
