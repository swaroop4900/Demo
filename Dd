Here's a revised message that includes your mention of the Flexi Live this week:

**Subject: Change in Personal Plans and Availability Update**

Dear [Manager's Name],

I wanted to inform you about a change in my personal plans. Due to my Flexi Live schedule with TCS this week, I had originally planned my baby’s naming ceremony for Friday, November 15th. Unfortunately, an unexpected passing in my father-in-law’s family has required us, by tradition, to postpone the ceremony.

We are now looking to reschedule it for next week. I may need to be unavailable on Friday, November 22nd, but I’ll carry my laptop with me and can be accessible if any urgent work arises.

Thank you for your understanding, and I apologize for the short notice. Please let me know if there’s anything specific you’d like me to address ahead of time.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
