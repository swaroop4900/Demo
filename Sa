**Subject:** Update on the Issue  

Hi [Recipient],  

I have discussed the issue with the team and here are the observations:  

1. If the template in question is not a custom Jenkins template, we will not provide support for it.  
2. Upon reviewing the logs, no major information was found, except that it was failing with an Ansible error.  
3. If this were a platform issue, it would have caused failures in all cases. However, both success and failure logs are in the same folder ([link](https://al-prod.systems.uk.c/wpbi)).  
4. After further discussion with the team, they confirmed that this is related to the template or configuration and not a platform issue.  

Based on these findings, I am closing the ticket.  

Best regards,  
Swaroop Potta
